# Assignment1
## Question1 :
the program ask the user to enter two number as input then check if the sum of the two number is less or greater than 100 
if its less then we print sum is less than 100
else we print sum is greater Or equal 100.
there is a picture in case the sum is less than 100:

## Question2:
In this program we convert  a fahrenheit tempreture to Celsius Tempreture Using
(X°F − 32) × 5/9  Formula
While X is the input that the user provide.
in this example X is 50 and 50 fahrenheit is 9.90 Celsius.

## Question3:
In This Question We Should Provide a Directory name or path as input,and the program search for the largest 10 files in the directory that provided ,
in case we didnt provide a directory name we will get the following error

else if every thing went right the program will print the largest 10 files, while at the first line will be the number of memory usage in kilobytes of a file and in the next line will be the name of the file.
